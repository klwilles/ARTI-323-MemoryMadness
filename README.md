# Memory Madness

Memory Madness is a matching card game developed by Southern Adventist University School of Visual Art and Design students as part of a collaborative class assignment in Interactive Media 2. The starting point was taken from Gary Rosenzweig's ActionScript 3.0 Game Programming University but was elaborated upon and customized heavily. 

You may play the latest version of the Flash game by downloading the playables zip file.
